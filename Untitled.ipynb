    "1. What exactly is []?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "  [] is an empty list or a lis without any elements we can insert values init\n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "2.In a list of values stored in a variable called spam, how would you assign the value &#39;hello&#39; as the\n",
    "third value? (Assume [2, 4, 6, 8, 10] are in spam.)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "spam=[2,4,6,8,10]\n",
    "in the place of 6  this &#39;hello&#39; number is added by using insert() function.\n",
    "\n",
    "spam.insert(2,'&#39;hello&#39;')\n",

    "\n",
    "ans:\n",
    "the above expression \n",
    "expression gives output as 3 lets put like spam[3]==6\n",
    "\n",
    "4. What is the value of spam[-1]?\n",
    "\n",
    "ans:\n",
    "spam=[2, 4, '&#39;hello&#39;', 6, 8, 10,'a','b','c','d']\n",
    "spam[-1]='d'\n",

    "5. What is the value of spam[:2]?\n",
    "ans:\n",
    "spam[:2] it will print first two elements of spam list.\n",
    "\n",
    "here first two elements will are [2,4]\n",

    "6. What is the value of bacon.index('cat')?\n",
    "ans:\n",
    "bacon=[3.14,'cat','11',True]\n",
    "bacon.index('cat')==1\n",
    "\n",
    "7. How does bacon.append(99) change the look of the list value in bacon?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "it will add the 99 on the bottom of list\n",
    "bacon=[3.14,'cat','11',True,99]\n",
    "\n",
    "8. How does bacon.remove(&#39;cat&#39;) change the look of the list in bacon?\n",

    "it removes the first cat in the bacon list\n",

    "\n",
    "9. What are the list concatenation and list replication operators?\n",
    "ans:\n",
    "list concatenation will done by '+' operator and replication is done by '*' operator\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "10. What is difference between the list methods append() and insert()?\n",
    "\n",
    "ans:\n",
    "\n",
    "append() function will only concat or add the elements in the bottom of a list \n",
    "\n",
    "insert() function that helps to add the elements to the list wherever we want in a list,It takes the position and elements on the input\n",
    "\n",
    "11. What are the two methods for removing items from a list?\n",
    "\n",
    "ans:\n",
    "two methods pop() and remove()\n",
    "\n",
    "pop() takes the index of the element and deletes the element\n",
    "\n",
    "remove() takes the exact element in a list and remove the element\n",
    "\n",
    "12. Describe how list values and string values are identical.\n",
    "\n",
    "ans:\n",
    "both are sequences,both can be indexed and and sliced,both support '*','+', in and not in operations.Both are iterable\n",
    "\n",
    "13. What is the difference between tuples and lists?\n",
    "\n",
    "ans:\n",
    "\n",
    "list is mutable and tuples are immutable \n",
    "list use square brackets and tuples use paranthesis\n",
    "list can have man number of elements and tuples have fixed length of elements\n",
    "list consume more memory than tuples\n",
    "\n",
    "14. How do you type a tuple value that only contains the integer 42?\n",
    "ans:\n",
    "t=(42,)\n",
    "\n",
    "15. How do you get a list value's tuple form? How do you get a tuple value's list form?\n",
    "ans:\n",
    "type conversion is used if list from tuple can be achieved by list(tuple)\n",
    "\n",
    "and  tuple can be achieved by tuple(list)\n",
    "\n",
    "16. Variables that'contain' list values are not necessarily lists themselves. Instead, what do they\n",
    "contain?\n",
    "\n",
    "ans:\n",
    "variable contain the the list actually it reference the list object in memory not the exact list.but if we change the variable it changes the list also\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "17. How do you distinguish between copy.copy() and copy.deepcopy()?\n",
    "ans: \n",
    "both are from copy library when copy.copy() it copies the list and stored in new storage  if any changes persists in the copied file it will reflect the original file and then deepcopy() is used it also copy the file and store the file in new location if any changes inside the file cannot impact in the original file\n"
