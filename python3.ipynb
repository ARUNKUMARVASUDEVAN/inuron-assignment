    "An abstract superclass is a class in object-oriented programming that is designed to be inherited by other classes but is not meant to be instantiated on its own. It serves as a blueprint for other classes to follow and provides a common interface and functionality that can be shared among its subclasses.\n",
    "\n",
    "An abstract superclass typically contains abstract methods, which are methods that are declared but not implemented in the superclass. The responsibility of implementing these abstract methods is left to the subclasses that inherit from the abstract superclass. This allows the abstract superclass to define a set of behaviors or operations that are expected to be implemented by its subclasses.\n",
    "\n",
    "By defining an abstract superclass, developers can create a hierarchy of related classes that share common functionality and behavior. This can help to reduce code duplication, improve maintainability, and make the code easier to understand and modify.\n",

    "In Python, abstract superclasses can be created using the `abc` module, which provides the `ABC` (Abstract Base Class) class and other related classes and functions for working with abstract classes. By inheriting from `ABC` and using the `@abstractmethod` decorator, developers can define abstract methods that must be implemented by subclasses."

    "\n",
    "To augment an inherited method in a subclass, the subclass can call the superclass's method within the subclass's method using the `super()` function. This allows the subclass to extend or modify the behavior of the inherited method, while still preserving the original behavior defined in the superclass.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example Python code that demonstrates how to augment an inherited method in a subclass:\n",

    "In Python, a class is a blueprint for creating objects, and a function is a block of reusable code that performs a specific task. Both classes and functions define a local scope, but the local scope of a class is different from that of a function in a few ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Variables: In a function, all variables defined within the function are local to the function and are not accessible outside of the function. In a class, variables defined within the class but outside of any method are considered class-level variables and can be accessed using the class name or any instance of the class. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Self parameter: When defining methods within a class, the first parameter is always `self`. The `self` parameter is a reference to the object being created or modified and allows methods to access and modify the object's attributes. In a function, there is no `self` parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Inheritance: A class can inherit attributes and methods from a parent class using inheritance, allowing it to reuse code and build upon existing functionality. In contrast, a function does not inherit attributes or methods from other functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Lifetime: A class exists as long as the program is running, while a function exists only for the duration of the function call. This means that the attributes and methods of a class are available for the entire duration of the program, while the variables defined within a function are only available for the duration of the function call.\n",
