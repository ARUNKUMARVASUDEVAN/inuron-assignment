    "Yes, you can create a program or function in Python that employs both positive and negative indexing to access elements in a string, list, or other sequence types. Positive indexing starts from 0 for the first element, while negative indexing starts from -1 for the last element and counts backward.\n",

    "There are typically no repercussions for using both positive and negative indexing within your program or function. Python supports these indexing methods to provide flexibility in accessing elements from both ends of a sequence. However, it's essential to ensure that the indices you use are within the valid range to avoid `IndexError` exceptions. Positive indices should be within the range `[0, len(sequence) - 1]`, and negative indices should be within the range `[-len(sequence), -1]`.\n",

    "Indexing and slicing are both techniques used to access elements within a sequence (like a string, list, or tuple) in Python, but they have distinct purposes and behaviors:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Indexing:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Purpose:**\n",
    "   - Indexing refers to the process of selecting a single element from a sequence based on its position, identified by an index (integer).\n",
    "   - It retrieves a specific element at a given position within the sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Syntax:**\n",
    "   - Indexing is performed using square brackets `[]` with an index value inside, like this: `my_sequence[index]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Usage:**\n",
    "   - You use indexing when you need to access or modify a single element within the sequence.\n",
    "   - It's commonly used to access characters in a string, elements in a list, or items in a tuple.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Result:**\n",
    "   - Indexing returns a single element from the sequence.\n",
    "   - The result is of the same type as the elements within the sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Slicing:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Purpose:**\n",
    "   - Slicing is the process of extracting a portion (substring or sublist) of a sequence by specifying a range of indices.\n",
    "   - It retrieves a subset of elements based on a specified start and end index.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Syntax:**\n",
    "   - Slicing uses the colon `:` operator inside square brackets to define the range: `my_sequence[start:end]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Usage:**\n",
    "   - Slicing is used when you need to work with a contiguous portion of the sequence rather than a single element.\n",
    "   - It's used to create new sequences from existing ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Result:**\n",
    "   - Slicing returns a new sequence (substring or sublist) containing the elements within the specified range.\n",
    "   - The result is of the same type as the original sequence, but it may be empty if the specified range is invalid.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, indexing is used to access or modify individual elements in a sequence by specifying their positions, while slicing is used to extract a portion of a sequence by specifying a range of positions. Indexing returns a single element, while slicing returns a new sequence containing a subset of elements. Both indexing and slicing are fundamental techniques for working with sequences in Python, and they are complementary in many programming tasks."

This behavior is designed to be forgiving and to prevent common off-by-one errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's what happens when you have an out-of-range index in a slicing expression:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If the start index is out of range:\n",
    "   - Python sets the start index to the beginning of the sequence (0 for positive indexing and -len(sequence) for negative indexing).\n",

    "\n",
    "2. If the end index is out of range:\n",
    "   - Python sets the end index to the end of the sequence (len(sequence) for positive indexing and -1 for negative indexing).\n",
    "   - The slice includes elements from the specified start index to the end index.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are examples to illustrate this behavior:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "my_sequence = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "\n",
    "# Start index is out of range (negative indexing)\n",
    "sliced1 = my_sequence[-10:3]  # Equivalent to my_sequence[0:3]\n",

    "# End index is out of range (positive indexing)\n",
    "sliced2 = my_sequence[2:10]  # Equivalent to my_sequence[2:5]\n",
    "# Result: [3, 4, 5]\n",
    "\n",
    "# Both start and end indexes are out of range\n",
    "sliced3 = my_sequence[10:20]  # Results in an empty list\n",

    "sliced4 = my_sequence[-5:7]  # Equivalent to my_sequence[0:5]\n",
    "# Result: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In all these cases, Python ensures that the slice remains within the valid range of indices for the sequence. If either the start or end index falls outside the valid range, Python adjusts them to the nearest valid index to prevent errors."

However, if you reassign the list parameter to a new list object within the function, it will create a local reference, and the original list outside the function will remain unchanged.\n",
