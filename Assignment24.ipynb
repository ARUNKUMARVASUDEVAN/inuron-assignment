    "Both `def` statements and `lambda` expressions are used to create functions in Python. However, they differ in their syntax and use cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "A `def` statement is a normal function definition that binds a function name to a function object. It can take any number of arguments and contains a block of statements that are executed when the function is called. Defining a function with `def` allows you to reuse the code by calling the function with different arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, a `lambda` expression is an anonymous function that is defined in a single line of code. It takes any number of arguments but can only have one expression. Lambda expressions are often used when you need to define a small, throwaway function that is used only once in your code, such as a key function for sorting or filtering.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key difference between `def` and `lambda` is that `def` creates a named function object, while `lambda` creates an unnamed function object that can be used as an expression. While both can be used to create functions, `lambda` expressions are more limited in their capabilities compared to `def` functions."

    "`map()`, `filter()`, and `reduce()` are three built-in functions in Python that are used for processing iterables (lists, tuples, etc.). Here are the differences between them:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `map()` takes a function and one or more iterables, applies the function to each element of the iterable(s), and returns a new iterable containing the result of the function applied to each element. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "my_list = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "new_list = list(map(lambda x: x * 2, my_list))\n",
    "print(new_list) # Output: [2, 4, 6]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- `filter()` takes a function and an iterable, applies the function to each element of the iterable, and returns a new iterable containing only the elements for which the function returns `True`. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\n",
    "new_list = list(filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, my_list))\n",
    "print(new_list) # Output: [2, 4, 6]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- `reduce()` takes a function and an iterable, applies the function to the first two elements of the iterable, then to the result and the next element, and so on, until all elements have been processed and a single result is obtained. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "from functools import reduce\n",
    "my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "result = reduce(lambda x, y: x + y, my_list)\n",
    "print(result) # Output: 15\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, `map()` applies a function to each element of an iterable and returns a new iterable, `filter()` returns a new iterable containing only the elements for which a function returns `True`, and `reduce()` applies a function to pairs of elements and returns a single result."

A recursive function works by solving the base case, which is the simplest version of the problem, and then building up to solve the larger problem by breaking it down into smaller sub-problems.\n",

    "Recursive functions can be used to solve a wide range of problems, such as traversing trees and graphs, computing factorials, and sorting algorithms. For example, the quicksort algorithm uses recursion to sort an array of elements by partitioning it into two smaller sub-arrays, sorting these sub-arrays recursively, and then combining them.\n",
