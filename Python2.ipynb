    "In this example, we define a class `Dog` with an `__init__` method that takes two parameters (`name` and `breed`) and sets them as properties of the object using `self.name` and `self.breed`. We also define two other methods, `bark` and `describe`, which can be called on any instance of the `Dog` class.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make an instance of this class, you can simply call the class like a function, passing any required parameters to the `__init__` method. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "my_dog = Dog(\"Fido\", \"Labrador\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This creates a new instance of the `Dog` class with the name \"Fido\" and the breed \"Labrador\", and assigns it to the variable `my_dog`. Now we can call methods on this instance:\n",
