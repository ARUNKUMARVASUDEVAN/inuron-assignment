    "The difference between enclosing a list comprehension in square brackets and parentheses is in the type of object that is created.\n",

    "When a list comprehension is enclosed in square brackets, a new list object is created. The elements of the list are the result of evaluating the expression in the comprehension for each item in the iterable.\n",

    "When a list comprehension is enclosed in parentheses, a generator object is created. A generator is an iterator that computes the values on-the-fly as they are requested, rather than creating the entire sequence at once. Generators are useful when dealing with large sequences that may not fit in memory all at once.\n",

    "\n",
    "An iterator is an object that can be iterated (looped) upon, meaning it can return its elements one at a time. Iterators implement two methods, `__iter__()` and `__next__()`, that allow them to be used in a for loop or with the `next()` function. The `__iter__()` method returns the iterator object itself, and the `__next__()` method returns the next element in the sequence. When there are no more elements, `__next__()` raises the `StopIteration` exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "A generator is a special type of iterator that is created using a function rather than a class. Generators use the `yield` statement to return values from the function, and each time the `yield` statement is executed, the generator's state is saved. The next time the generator is called, it resumes execution from where it left off, instead of starting over from the beginning. This makes generators more memory-efficient than regular iterators, since they do not need to store the entire sequence in memory at once.\n",

    "3. The function has a different control flow than a regular function: Generator functions have a different control flow than regular functions, since they can be paused and resumed. When a generator function is called, it does not execute the entire function body at once, but instead executes the function body until it reaches the first `yield` statement. When the generator is resumed, execution resumes from where it left off, until it reaches the next `yield` statement, and so on.\n",

    "Both `map()` calls and list comprehensions in Python are used to apply a function to a sequence of elements and generate a new sequence of values based on the original sequence. However, there are some differences between the two:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Syntax: List comprehensions have a simpler and more concise syntax than `map()` calls. List comprehensions are enclosed in square brackets and use a compact syntax for expressing the operation to be applied to each element. On the other hand, `map()` calls require a lambda function or a named function to be defined separately, and the operation is applied using the `map()` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Type of result: List comprehensions always return a list, while `map()` calls return an iterator that can be converted to a list if needed. This means that list comprehensions can be more memory-intensive than `map()` calls for large sequences, since they generate the entire sequence in memory at once.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Functionality: `map()` calls can be more flexible than list comprehensions, since they can apply a function to multiple sequences simultaneously. List comprehensions only allow applying an operation to a single sequence at a time. However, this flexibility comes at the cost of more complex syntax and potentially slower performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example that shows the difference between a `map()` call and a list comprehension that perform the same operation:\n",

    "In this example, both the `map()` call and the list comprehension generate a new sequence of squares from the original sequence of numbers.
