    "The purpose of Python's Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is to allow programmers to create software that models real-world objects or concepts as objects with their own attributes (data) and behaviors (methods).\n",
    "\n",
    "OOP provides several benefits, such as code reusability, modularity, and abstraction. It allows for the creation of reusable, modular code that can be easily maintained and extended. Additionally, OOP enables developers to represent complex systems or ideas in a more natural and intuitive way, making it easier to understand and reason about software.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, OOP is implemented using classes, which define the blueprint for objects. Classes encapsulate related data and functions into a single unit, and objects are instances of those classes. Python's OOP features include inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction, which provide a powerful and flexible way to build software systems"

    "In Python, when an attribute is accessed on an instance of a class, or on the class itself, the interpreter first looks for the attribute in the instance's own namespace. If the attribute is not found in the instance's namespace, it then looks for the attribute in the class's namespace.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the attribute is still not found in the class's namespace, the interpreter looks in the namespace of the first base class (i.e., the class from which the current class inherits). If the attribute is not found in the first base class's namespace, it continues up the chain of inheritance, checking each subsequent base class in turn, until it either finds the attribute or reaches the end of the inheritance chain.\n",
    "\n",
    "This process is known as the Method Resolution Order (MRO), and it is determined by the linearization of the class hierarchy. The MRO is computed using the C3 linearization algorithm, which takes into account the order of inheritance, and ensures that each attribute is searched for only once in the entire inheritance chain.\n",
