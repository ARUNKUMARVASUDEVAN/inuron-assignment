1. What is the result of the code, and why?
>>> def func(a, b=6, c=8):
print(a, b, c)
>>> func(1, 2)


The code defines a function `func()` with three parameters `a`, `b`, and `c`. The `b` and `c` parameters have default values of `6` and `8`, respectively. Inside the function, the values of the parameters are printed to the console using the `print()` function.

When the function `func()` is called with `func(1, 2)`, the value `1` is passed to the `a` parameter and the value `2` is passed to the `b` parameter. Since the `c` parameter is not passed a value, it takes its default value of `8`.

So the output of the code is:

```
1 2 8
```

In summary, the code defines a function with default parameter values and prints the values of the parameters when the function is called with some arguments. The missing value for the third parameter takes its default value.

2. What is the result of this code, and why?
>>> def func(a, b, c=5):
print(a, b, c)
>>> func(1, c=3, b=2)


The code defines a function `func()` with three parameters `a`, `b`, and `c`. The `c` parameter has a default value of `5`. Inside the function, the values of the parameters are printed to the console using the `print()` function.

When the function `func()` is called with `func(1, c=3, b=2)`, the value `1` is passed to the `a` parameter, the value `2` is passed to the `b` parameter, and the value `3` is passed to the `c` parameter. 

When calling the function, the argument `c=3` specifies that the value of the `c` parameter should be `3`. Similarly, the argument `b=2` specifies that the value of the `b` parameter should be `2`. Since `a` is not specified in the arguments, it takes the value `1` by default.

So the output of the code is:

```
1 2 3
```

In summary, the code defines a function with default parameter values and prints the values of the parameters when the function is called with some arguments. The arguments override the default values, and the parameters can be passed in any order as long as they are specified by name.

3. How about this code: what is its result, and why?
>>> def func(a, *pargs):
print(a, pargs)
>>> func(1, 2, 3)


The code defines a function `func()` with a mandatory parameter `a` and a variable-length argument list `pargs`. Inside the function, the values of `a` and `pargs` are printed to the console using the `print()` function.

When the function `func()` is called with `func(1, 2, 3)`, the value `1` is passed to the `a` parameter, and the values `2` and `3` are passed to the `pargs` parameter as a tuple. 

The `*` operator in the parameter list before `pargs` causes the function to accept any number of positional arguments after the mandatory `a` argument, and store them in a tuple named `pargs`. The first argument `1` is passed to `a`, and the remaining arguments `2` and `3` are packed into a tuple and passed to `pargs`.

So the output of the code is:

```
1 (2, 3)
```

In summary, the code defines a function that takes a variable-length argument list and prints the arguments passed to it as a tuple. The first argument is mandatory, while the remaining arguments can be any number of positional arguments.

4. What does this code print, and why?
>>> def func(a, **kargs):
print(a, kargs)
>>> func(a=1, c=3, b=2)


The code defines a function `func()` that takes a mandatory argument `a` and an arbitrary number of keyword arguments, packed into a dictionary `kargs`. Inside the function, the values of `a` and `kargs` are printed to the console using the `print()` function.

When the function `func()` is called with `func(a=1, c=3, b=2)`, the value `1` is passed to the `a` parameter as a keyword argument, and the values `2` and `3` are passed to the `b` and `c` parameters respectively, also as keyword arguments.

The `**` operator in the parameter list before `kargs` causes the function to accept any number of keyword arguments and store them in a dictionary named `kargs`.

So the output of the code is:

```
1 {'c': 3, 'b': 2}
```

In summary, the code defines a function that takes a mandatory argument and an arbitrary number of keyword arguments, and prints the arguments passed to it as a dictionary.

5. What gets printed by this, and explain?
>>> def func(a, b, c=8, d=5): print(a, b, c, d)
>>> func(1, *(5, 6))


The code defines a function named `func()` which takes four parameters: `a`, `b`, `c` with a default value of `8`, and `d` with a default value of `5`. The function simply prints the values of its arguments to the console.

When the function is called with `func(1, *(5,6))`, the first two arguments `1` and `5` are passed to the `a` and `b` parameters respectively, leaving `c` and `d` with their default values of `8` and `5`.

The `*` operator in `*(5,6)` unpacks the tuple `(5,6)` into individual positional arguments, which are then passed to the `func()` function.

Therefore, the output of the function call is:

```
1 5 8 5
```

The values `1` and `5` are assigned to `a` and `b`, respectively. `c` has its default value of `8`, and `d` has its default value of `5`.

6. what is the result of this, and explain?
>>> def func(a, b, c): a = 2; b[0] = 'x'; c['a'] = 'y'
>>> l=1; m=[1]; n={'a':0}
>>> func(l, m, n)
>>> l, m, n



The function `func` takes three arguments `a`, `b`, and `c`. When this function is called with arguments `l`, `m`, and `n`, the variable `l` is passed as is, while `m` and `n` are passed by reference.

Within the function, `a` is assigned a value of `2`, which doesn't affect `l` because integers are immutable objects. `b[0]` is assigned a value of `'x'` which changes the first element of the list `m` to `'x'`. `c['a']` is assigned a value of `'y'` which adds a new key-value pair `'a':'y'` to the dictionary `n`.

After the function call, `l` is still equal to `1`, `m` is now equal to `['x']`, and `n` is now equal to `{'a': 'y'}`. So the output will be `(1, ['x'], {'a': 'y'})`.
